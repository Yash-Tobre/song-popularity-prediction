## Song Popularity Prediction
This repository contains a project that uses machine learning to predict the popularity of songs based on various audio features. By analyzing a song's characteristics, the model aims to forecast its popularity score, providing insights useful for music industry professionals, independent artists, and streaming platforms.

#### Project Overview
The Song Popularity Prediction project leverages song metadata and audio features to estimate popularity, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions. This model can benefit:

**Music Labels:** Optimizing investments in songs likely to be popular.
**Independent Artists:** Selecting singles and anticipating audience reception.
**Streaming Platforms:** Improving recommendation engines and playlist curation.

## Key Files
- Analysis.ipynb: Contains data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- app.py - The file that has streamlit app code.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, and install the required libraries by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Yash-Tobre/song-popularity-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd song-popularity-prediction

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Analysis.ipynb

## Project Workflow

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Import data, clean, and preprocess to prepare for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore relationships between audio features (e.g., danceability, energy) and popularity.
3. Feature Engineering: Select and transform features that influence popularity.
4. Model Building: Train machine learning models to predict song popularity.
5. Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R².
6. Results Interpretation: Visualize feature importance and predicted vs. actual popularity.

## Model Details
The project experiments with various machine learning algorithms to predict song popularity scores. The model selection process involves cross-validation and tuning to improve accuracy, and visualizations illustrate feature impacts on popularity predictions.

## Applications
The insights and predictions generated by this model can support:

    1. Music Labels: Strategic investments in trending songs.
    2. Independent Artists: Better-informed release strategies.
    3. Streaming Platforms: Enhanced user experience with refined recommendations and playlists.
    4. Radio Stations: Dynamic playlist curation to engage listeners.

## Future Work

Potential improvements include:

    Expanding the feature set with additional song metadata.
    Testing advanced models like deep learning architectures.
    Integrating real-time streaming data for dynamic predictions.
